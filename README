Thank you for downloading my software!
XOR cryper for passwords and not only!
To use it use command 'make' to build.
 
Syntax : ./xorc [options] [message file] [key or key file]

Program works with two arguments '-c' and '-d'.
-c means coding. Program waits for string to crypt. Program outputs N - number of characters, 
and N decimal ascii values of each character.
-d means decoding. Program waits for number of characters in message (N).
Then program waits for N decimanl ascii values.

Please report any bugs at francisiek.yt@gmail.com.
Have fun! :)

Take in mind that force of crypter depends on yyour key, and every messege crypted by this program can be break (but this takes a LOT of time). 
I'm not taking any responsibility.
