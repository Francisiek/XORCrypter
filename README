Thank you for downloading my software!
XOR cryper for passwords and not only!
To use it use command 'make' to build.

Program works with two arguments '-c' and '-d'.
-c means coding. Program waits for string to crypt. Program outputs N - number of characters, 
and N decimal ascii values of each character.
-d means decoding. Program waits for number of characters in message (N).
Then program waits for N decimanl ascii values.

In every mode you can type key to crypt/decrypt on the end of input, or either as a argument after -c or -d.

Im recomennding to use it by storing ascii values in file.
Example:
./xorc -c mykey > crypted_file.txt
./xorc -d mykey < crypted_file.txt

Please report any bugs at francisiek.yt@gmail.com.
Have fun! :)

Take in mind that force of crypter depends on yyour key, and every messege crypted by this program can be break (but this takes a LOT of time). 
I'm not taking any responsibility.
