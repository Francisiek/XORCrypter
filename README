Thank you for downloading my software!
XOR cryper for passwords and not only!

BUILD
To build program use 'make' command.

USAGE
Syntax : xorc [options] [message file] [key file]

Program works with two arguments '-c' and '-d'.
-c means coding. Program tekes file, crypt it with key and then changes it to inary file with crytped text.
-d means decoding. Program takes already crypted BINARY file and change it's comtent to decrypted text.

Please report any bugs at 'francisiek.yt@gmail.com'.
Have fun! :)

Take in mind that force of crypter depends on your key and every messege 
crypted by this program can be break (but this takes a LOT of time). 
I'm not taking any responsibility.
