Thank you for downloading my software!
XOR crypter for passwords and not only!

Take in mind that force of crypter depends on your key 
and every messege encrypted by this program can be broke 
(but this takes a LOT of time). 
I'm not taking any responsibility.

BUILD
To build program use 'make' command.

INSTALL
To install use 'make install'

UNINSTALL
Type 'make uninstall'

USAGE
Usage: xorc -[hvu] or [text file] [key file]
Program crypts [text file] with [key file] by
changing it's content to crypted mess.
To decrypt, crypt file once more with the same key.
To conclude, if you crypt your file even number of times, 
the file will be like it was before.

ARGS
-h, -u shows help
-v show program info
no args shows -v and -h

EXAMPLES
xorc my_secret_msg key
xorc -v

ERRORS
Values returned by program mean:
0 - everything's good
1 - failed to open file
2 - failed read/write to file
3 - failed to allocate memory
4 - bad arguments syntax
