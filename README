Thank you for downloading my software!
XOR crypter for passwords and not only!

Take in mind that force of crypter depends on your key and every messege 
crypted by this program can be break (but this takes a LOT of time). 
I'm not taking any responsibility.

USAGE
Usage: xorc -[hvu] or [text file] [key file]
Porogram crypts [text file] with [key file] by

To conclude, if you crypt your file even number of times, the file will be like it was before.
